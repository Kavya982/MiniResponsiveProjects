# Registration and Login Form with Mock Database

## Description
This project is a **Registration and Login Form** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and a **Mock Database** to store user credentials temporarily. It demonstrates basic authentication without a real backend.

## Features
- User registration with input validation
- Login authentication using a mock database
- Password security checks
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Error handling and feedback messages

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for form structure
- **CSS** for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for form validation and mock database handling


## Project Structure
```
Registration-Login-Form/
│── index.html       # Registration & Login Form
│── style.css        # CSS file for styling
│── script.js        # JavaScript file for form handling
│── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
- The registration form collects user details and stores them in a mock database (JavaScript object or localStorage).
- The login form verifies the user credentials against the stored data.
- Users can log in if their credentials match the mock database.

## Future Enhancements
- Connect to a real backend using Node.js and MongoDB/MySQL
- Implement password encryption for security
- Add email verification and password reset features
